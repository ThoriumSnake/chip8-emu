# chip8-emu
A barely working Chip8 emulator.

WARNING

Description is not a joke (Alright it is), for me this is a stepping stone project for learning C and emulator development, wouldn't recommend basing your own code off of this.

Some resources you may find useful in your own endeavours:

[Austin Morlan's Building a Chip-8 Emulator [C++]](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/) (I'd recommend starting here)

[Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)

According to [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3ca4ry/writing_a_chip8_interpreteremulator_in_c14_10/csu7w8k/) Cowgod's reference has some inaccuracies and recommends [Mastering Chip-8](https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8/wiki/Mastering-CHIP%E2%80%908)
